This program made for renaming file extensions.
I had a quakeworld server with many maps. The server did not like .BSP
So I made a python 3 script that would change .BSP to .bsp but I made it little be more flexible
it can do any file extensions
the file extension has to be the same as the original at least.

qmmewname.py -p path to the files -e .BSP -ne .bsp

This one will only work with Linux
